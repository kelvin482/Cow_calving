# CowCalving Roadmap

## Objective
Transform the current prototype into a professional, unique, and demo-ready hackathon product that combines practical calving workflows with AI-assisted decision support readiness.

## Guiding Principles
- Build for real farm operations, not generic UI demos.
- Prioritize trust, clarity, and safety in recommendations.
- Keep UX simple under field conditions (mobile-first, low cognitive load).
- Demonstrate measurable impact in the final pitch.

## Phase 1: Product Positioning and Scope Lock (Day 1)
### Deliverables
- Final product statement (one sentence)
- Primary user persona (farmer) and secondary persona (vet)
- Defined differentiation:
  - calving risk visibility,
  - stage-aware recommendations,
  - escalation-first safety logic

### Success Criteria
- Team can explain problem, solution, and uniqueness in under 30 seconds.

## Phase 2: Professional UI System (Days 1-3)
### Deliverables
- Standardized design tokens (color, spacing, typography, radius, shadows)
- Consistent component set (buttons, cards, forms, alerts, nav)
- Visual hierarchy improvements for key pages:
  - Home
  - Calving Stages
  - Checklist
  - Login/Signup

### Success Criteria
- UI consistency across pages
- Professional visual quality on desktop and mobile
- No broken alignment, spacing, or typography patterns

## Phase 3: Core Differentiator Features (Days 3-6)
### Deliverables
- Calving Risk Score input workflow
- Stage-based recommendation engine (rule-based MVP)
- Critical alert states with clear call-to-action:
  - Observe
  - Prepare
  - Contact Vet

### Success Criteria
- User can input signs and receive clear actionable output in one flow.

## Phase 4: Trust, Explainability, and Safety (Days 6-8)
### Deliverables
- “Why this recommendation” explanation block
- Safety disclaimer and escalation guidance
- Structured critical-warning copy for emergency scenarios

### Success Criteria
- Recommendations are understandable and defensible
- No black-box output in user-facing guidance

## Phase 5: Demo-Ready Engineering (Days 8-10)
### Deliverables
- Stable user flow across account and farmer pages
- Core test coverage for:
  - risk logic,
  - routing stability,
  - high-priority user actions
- Seed data for realistic demonstrations

### Success Criteria
- End-to-end demo runs without failure
- Major flows validated by tests

## Phase 6: Hackathon Packaging (Days 10-12)
### Deliverables
- Final README with setup, architecture, and value proposition
- Demo script (3-minute and 5-minute versions)
- Pitch assets:
  - problem
  - solution
  - uniqueness
  - impact

### Success Criteria
- Team can deliver a confident, repeatable live demo.

## Phase 7: Final Polish and Submission (Days 12-14)
### Deliverables
- Accessibility and readability pass
- Performance cleanup (image and static asset optimization)
- Copy polish for professional tone consistency
- Submission checklist completion

### Success Criteria
- Production-like presentation quality
- Submission package complete and coherent

## Professionalization Checklist
- Consistent UI system
- Strong visual hierarchy
- Clear user journey from problem to action
- Explainable outputs
- Safety-aware escalation flow
- Reliable demo path
- Clean documentation and pitch alignment

## Risk Register (Hackathon Reality)
- Scope creep -> keep MVP strict and staged
- UI over-investment without function -> tie every screen to decision value
- AI complexity delays -> ship rule-based core first, AI integration second
- Demo instability -> freeze core flow 24 hours before final presentation

## Definition of Done (Hackathon)
Project is considered hackathon-ready when:
- It looks polished and professional,
- It demonstrates a unique decision-support workflow,
- It includes safety and explainability,
- It can be demoed reliably in under 5 minutes,
- It has complete documentation for judges and reviewers.
